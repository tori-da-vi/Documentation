CAVISE Simulator (Project 982)
=============================

Overview
--------

This repository contains the tools used in the development
of the DRL-FL team, as well as our own developments - **CAPI** and others.

History
-------

**OpenCDA** and **Artery** are two separate tools that can work
and were developed separately, however, in 2023 & 2024, the DRL&FL team implemented
a protocol for the interaction of these tools within the framework of the basic scenario *realistic_town06_cosim*
and it is called CAPI.

Both simulators use their modules to interact together, in **Artery** there is a class
**CommunicationManager** (part of the comms static library), which provides network
interaction with artery in a separate thread, synchronizes requests from several cavs and collects
data from them.

In OpenCDA, **CommunicationManager** is part of CavWorld and essentially just one of the components
responsible for interacting with **Artery**. Methods of serialization and deserialization of data,
that was sent to **Artery** and received from it are also implemented.

Compiling protobuf to source code files is part of the **Artery** compilation routine.

OpenCDA
~~~~~~~

Enter the OpenCDA container:

.. code:: bash

   docker exec -it opencda bash

Run a scenario:

.. code:: bash

   python opencda.py -t rsu_check

Run SUMO during simulation:

.. code:: bash

   python opencda.py -t rsu_check --cosim

Enable free camera movement:

.. code:: bash

   python opencda.py -t rsu_check --cosim --free-spectator

Run cooperative perception models:

.. code:: bash

   python opencda.py -t rsu_check --cosim --free-spectator \
   --with-coperception --model-dir opencda/coperception_models/point_pillar_where2comm_v2xset --fusion-method intermediate

For help:

.. code:: bash

   python opencda.py -h

Artery
~~~~~~

Enter the Artery container:

.. code:: bash

   docker exec -it artery bash
   cd build/Release/

Run a scenario in Artery:

.. code:: bash

   cmake --build . --target run_realistic_town06_cosim

Start SUMO (see SUMO section), then run the OpenCDA scenario:

.. code:: bash

   python opencda.py -t realistic_town06_cosim -c --with-capi

Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Carla Error: "Town06 is not found"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensure the city has changed in Carla, then retry the scenario.

OpenCDA Error: "No module named ‘opencood.utils.box_overlaps’"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

   cd OpenCOOD
   python opencood/utils/setup.py build_ext --inplace

Display Errors in Artery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

   qt.qpa.xcb: could not connect to display :0

Run on host:

.. code:: bash

   xhost +local:docker

(Additionally) Artery development
---------------------------------

You may only need to collect **Artery** locally for syntax highlighting to work correctly.
To do this, run these commands:

.. code:: bash

   source configure.sh
   cd artery/
   source ./tools/setup/configure.sh
   ./tools/setup/build.py -b -c --config Debug --link

(Additionally) Interface info
-----------------------------

To run, you need:

.. code:: bash

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python interface.py

After completing the previous step, you will be taken to the interface:

.. image:: images/interface-main-page.png

Overview
- Select File: Choose a Docker Compose configuration file.
- Custom Parameters: Specify additional Docker Compose options (optional).
- Select Services: Specify which services to start, stop, or restart (optional).
- Build Button: Builds the Docker services.
- Up Button: Starts the Docker services.
- Down Button: Stops and removes the Docker containers.
- Restart Button: Restarts the Docker services.

Usage
~~~~~

1. Select File (File Selector)
   - Purpose: Choose a Docker Compose configuration file.
   - Where to Write: In this field, enter the name of the configuration file you want to use. If no file is selected, the form will automatically use the first file in the list.
2. Custom Parameters (Custom Params Input)
   - Purpose: Specify any additional parameters that will be passed to Docker Compose commands.
   - Where to Write: Enter custom flags or options for the Docker Compose command. These can include options like --build, --pull, --quiet, etc.
     You can view the full list of parameters by following here: https://gabrieldemarmiesse.github.io/python-on-whales/
3. Select Services (Services Input)
   - Purpose: Specify which services from your Docker Compose file should be affected by the command.
   - Where to Write: Enter the name of the services you want to start, stop, or restart. By default, the form will try to use the "main sim" service.

Buttons for Docker Compose Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These buttons are the primary actions you will use in this form. Each button will execute a corresponding Docker Compose command with the parameters you specify.

1. Build (Build Button)
   - Purpose: This button will run the docker compose build command to build your Docker services based on the selected file and parameters.
2. Up (Up Button)
   - Purpose: This button will run the docker compose up command, which starts the Docker services.
3. Down (Down Button)
   - Purpose: This button will run the docker compose down command to stop the services and remove the associated containers.
4. Restart (Restart Button)
   - Purpose: This button will run the docker compose restart command to restart services without shutting down the entire environment.

Output Area (Script Output)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Purpose: Displays the logs and status of the actions you perform.
- What to Expect: After clicking any button (e.g., Build, Up, Down, Restart), the output will appear here. It shows real-time logs, errors, or success messages from Docker Compose.

Admin Panel -> ComponentName Info
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Shows hardware resources used by the container and his logs in real-time mode

(Additionally) Generate Compose Configs
---------------------------------------

CAVISE docker-compose generator. This tool is used to dynamically

Create docker-compose configs depending on one's needs. Originally,
the needs were:
- use local builds or pull containers from remotes
- optional artery mount
these might be extended further.
